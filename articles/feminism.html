                   <p>Let's go back to me being a young girl, say 12 years or so. I did not know what Feminism meant, but I remember being told I'm too rude for a girl. Or was it rough? Or, Laid back? I don't remember. But I used to like being associated
with all these tags, on the inside, believe it or not. I sorted pride in "not being
like other girls", and more like a guy instead. Because girls are fragile and
typical, whereas guys are strong and COOL. Because, of course they are.</p>
<p>Let's move to the 2016 me swiftly, who cringes even before someone utters
such, *pardon my French*, Bullcrap out of their pie-holes. I cannot physically
roll my eyes back any further when people say things like , "You're really funny
for a girl" or "You're really non-fussy for a girl". And to my fellow women out
there who say things like, "I like hanging out with guys because they're less
drama", I'm sorry you didn't read any History back in schol. There's a special
place in hell reserved for you, don't fret. With these, no-drama guys of yours,
possibly Winston Churchill and/or Adolph Hitler.</p>
<p>Anyway, before you pin me down to be the "bra-burning" (just FYI, they were
never really burnt, it's just a symbol), "man-hating", "witchcraft practising"
Feminist, let's venture into all the right When's and Why's.</p>
<p>When does one turn into a Feminist has two answers. First, when everyday, you
see, hear, experience and share the ridiculously pathetic discrimination around
you, and consciously decide, how you can't take it anymore. Second, when you
look up the meaning of Feminism. The emotions are somewhat the order of,
"Oh! There you are, I've been looking to put all this into a word."</p>
<p>Women have fought for sexual violence, gender-based sex selection, the right
for women to wear whatever they want and walks the streets anytime,
breastfeed their babies in public, stereotyping, wage-gaps and what not. That's a
lot to fight for. We've fought these battles being daughters, mothers, sisters,
wives, only because of one thing that people keep forgetting. Women. Are.
Human. Beings. Trans women, Dalit women, Women with HIV, Queer women,
Prostitutes. All of them.</p>
<p>You've grown up in a way, which makes you presume that a woman doesn't
split her bills, fixes her appliances, drinks alcohol, holds it like a boss, abuses
like a sailor and gets work done faster than Usain Bolt, is not an excuse for
being a judgmental stereotypical prick, frankly. And surprising, a large number
of these "Pricks" are women, even biologically impossible so.</p>
<p>When are we gonna stop slut-shaming, fat-shaming, liberal-shaming, thoughtshaming
and more shamings I can't think of, our fellow gender creatures? Why
is a woman with a healthy coitus appetite, sleazy and slutty? Whereas, a guy
with the same characteristics is just "living the life". We're so ashamed to
discuss Sex, that we've been faking orgasms for centuries amidst the lack of
self-awareness and explorations. If she's wearing really short shorts to college,
let her. It's the same liberality which'll affirm your decision of wearing sweat
pants to college, too; you know. Fat is not an abuse. It's a body type. Skinny
people don't need to "eat". Everybody does. It's about time we realised we need
to break out of these conventions infested so deep into our heads, clouding our
sense of humanity.</p>
<p>This can make an amazing new year's resolution. Like, Hey 2016, Sorry for
being borderline misogynistic. 2017, Here's to a year full of feminism and other
wonderful things.</p>
<p>Although, I hope you don't get into Feminism debates. A friend of mine, who
could't stop herself from fiercely jabbering onto keyboards everytime anyone
defamed feminism, recently posted how tired she was of explainig something so
basic and logical. I'd say, we've all been there. Sooner or Later. I, for one, don't
preach people that don't matter. I realised a long time back that we live in a
world so delusional, you can make a person watch a Ram Gopal Verma movie
over Martin Scorsese.</[>
<p>All in all, dear ladies, we're Cummins College of Engineering FOR WOMEN.
We're supposed to be the badassest feminist power that there is. Like, look at
the amount of stereotypes we broke in our goodamn name! It's about time we
became more vocal and social about it. Feel free to tag me in random relatable
facebook posts and asking me for good comebacks for Racist, misogynist
creatures around.</p>
