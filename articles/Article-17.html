                    <p>Whether it is Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat, social media is constantly  thought of as the reason this generation does not have a real social life. The only thing people see are folks sitting and staring at the screen of their laptops or mobile phones. But as much as the older generations want to believe that technology is destroying the authenticity of living life and that young people these days are morbidly obsessed with their phones, they aren't seeing what's really going on.</p>

<p>There is a fine line between using social media and overusing social media. Once you start to display poor manners in front of your elders or even your peers, you're sure to be called out on it.</p>

<div class="text-center">

<p>People who have a gadget in their hands are immediately looked down upon. Why is the girl checking her Facebook feed rather than socialising with her co-workers? Why does he need to text someone even when he is between his college mates? What work could a couple out on a date possibly have with their smartphones? </p>

<p>Well, the problem here is that technology has not changed us. It has just made it easier for us to engage in behaviours that we would be exhibiting anyway. 16-year-old girls spend over 15 minutes to choose their best selfie, upload it on Instagram, and take it down if they do not get enough likes. This behaviour is associated with social media which is apparently ruining the new generation, making them attention-seeking and appearance driven. But the thing is, teenagers have always strived to be liked and sought the attention of their peers. Selfies on Instagram is just an evolution of the same behaviour. </p>

<p>Social media is not essentially ruining social interactions. In fact, it enables us to connect with people that would, otherwise, be really difficult to reach. Some may say that if you want to interact with people, you should interact with the ones around you, and that is probably true on certain occasions. But on other occasions, I'm just not able to comprehend why should we be forced to interact with those physically close to us instead of with the people that we really want to interact with. People should be able to interact with whoever they please without being judged for using social media to do so.</p>

<div class="text-center">
<img src="img/17-3.jpeg">
</div>

<p>People share their day-to-day experiences, hoping to look back to them sometime later in life. Yes, some of the posts can be entirely stupid, but you can always choose to ignore them without making a fuss out of it! Another example of social media masking the "things that actually matter", is people uploading their activities online. For example, lots of folks complain about people who take pictures of the food they order at restaurants and post them on Snapchat or wherever. Is it wrong to create a permanent memento of an otherwise temporary experience, to capture a photo of the effort people back in the kitchen have put in to make the food look attractive?  To me, such complaints reflect a lack of understanding of how modern social media works.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we need to stop thinking social media is ruining everything, making us a slave to it, mindlessly using our smartphones all the time. It is not. It is enriching our lives, connecting us to the people that matter the most to us regardless of how far away they are, connecting us to all kinds of people whom we wouldn't have met otherwise. All we need to do is find a balance, incorporating social media into our lives without being devoid of any real life interactions at all. 
Let's stop pretending our lives and society would be better without social media. More importantly, let's stop blaming technology for natural human behaviors.<br>
It is not replacing real interaction, it is augmenting it!</p>
