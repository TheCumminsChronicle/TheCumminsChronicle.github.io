                    <p>Lets face it, 2016 has not been a good year for the world in general. But if there was one silver lining, it was the movies. 2016 has been a great year for all kinds of movies. From larger than life superhero movies which blew our minds away to smaller, independent films that touched our heart, we have been spoilt for choice.With the number of great films slated for a 2017 release, the next year is guaranteed to be as good or even better than this one. So let's get to the most anticipated releases of the new year:</p>
<h3>1. Beauty and the Beast</h3>
<p>The wait for this has been excruciating. With a pitch perfect cast including Emma Watson (Belle), Dan Stevens (Beast), Luke Evans (Gaston),  Sir Ian McKellan and Josh Gad expectations for this movie have been sky high. The original version released in 1991 was the only animated movie to ever be nominated for an oscar in the Best Picture category and is regarded as one of the finest movies Disney ever made. Heartbreaking and joyous all at once, let’s hope this one matches the original.</p>

<h3>2. Justice League</h3>
<p>2016 was the year of superhero movies and Marvel studios emerged as the clear victor in the competition with D.C Studios. But this year, D.C seems to be gunning for first place. When the trailer was released at Comic Con this year, it caused a frenzy among comic afficianados and superhero buffs alike. Superheroes like Batman, Aquaman, Wonder Women, Flash and many more appear in this movie and the pressure is immense, to say the least.</p>

<h3>3. Spider-Man:Homecoming</h3>
<p>Captain America:Civil War had too many superheroes to count but Spider Man clearly stood out. Tom Holland nailed the character to the T, with his chemistry with Robert Downey Jr. providing a lot of laughs, and they just had two scenes together. Both of them are returning to Spider Man:Homecoming and audiences can expect a riot. This is the second time that the Spider Man series has been rebooted and the film is under pressure to deliver. But if the trailer is any indication, they have got a huge hit on their hands.   </p>

<h3>4. Logan</h3>
<p>Hugh Jackman has been playing the mutant Wolverine for 17 years. That’s the longest time that any actor has played a superhero and we don’t want to see him go. But the actor himself said that it was time to pass the mantle onto someone else and that he is proud to exit with Logan. The trailer showed that the film is going to be more grittier and darker than its previous installments and fans are all for it. With this being his last bow as Wolverine, we are definitely not missing watching it.</p>

<h3>5. Wonder Woman</h3>
<p>Goosebumps. That's the only word to describe the Wonder Woman trailer. Her appearance in Batman vs. Superman was the only good thing about the rather lifeless movie and people were clamoring for more. And boy, did the trailer deliver. Badass, feminist, powerful, takes-no-shit-from-anyone, the list of adjectives to describe her could go on forever.But more than that, if the movie turns out to be anything like the trailer it’ll be an inspiration for millions of girls everywhere around the world.</p>

<h3>6. Dunkirk</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan, the genius behind mindbending movies such as Inception, Interstellar and Momento returns to a subject which may be unfamiliar territory for him.But if his filmography proves one thing, its that nothing can match the breadth of his imagination. Based on the Dunkirk evacuation during World War 2 in which allied soldiers were rescued from enemy fire through sheer bravery and determination, the subject matter is definitely an intriguing one. This one will be watched more for the star power of its prolific director rather than the star power of its actors.    </p>
