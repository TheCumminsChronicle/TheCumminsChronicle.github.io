                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>The nation just can't stop rejoicing for the past two days. Finally, a news of some action across the LOC where the blood spilled is not Indian. Finally, we taught a lesson to the enemies and made it clear to the world that we are not to be taken for granted and the terrorist forces and those harboring them will not be spared.</p>

                    <blockquote>The Indian army conducted surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) against terrorist camps operating inside Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), inflicting heavy damage on terror training camps and killing significant number of terrorist who planning to infiltrate into our territory.</blockquote>

                    <p>announced DGMO Ranbir Singh in the press conference on Thursday morning (29/09/2016).<br>
He further added that in the past one year there have been more than 20 infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir and other areas which have claimed a number of lives of soldiers and civilians. Defense expert believe this step to be necessary as Pakistan had already crossed the red line and appreciated the efforts of artificial intelligence system which informed the Army whereabouts of the terror launch-pads.
</p>
<p>These surgical operations were carried out by Special Forces of the Indian Army. Special Forces were para dropped across the border at midnight to start the operation. The Special Forces are the most powerful and skillful forces of the Indian Army. They are trained to be masters in weapons, navigation, communication and medicine. And to be a part of the most dangerous and fiercest forces of Indian Army these men have willingly put their lives through hell. To join the Special Forces they have to undergo a 90 day probation where they are stripped off their ranks and put through very high standards of training in which they have to show extreme endurance and still be highly motivated.<br>
From breakfast being served when you are covered from head to toe in sewage to being forcefully drowned into a 12 feet tank with your hands and legs tied and to being able to stomach anything, every part of their training has a reason and tests a particular skill. In these 90 days, comes a 36 hours drill where the probies are "<b>pushed till they break</b>". The exercises they go through are unthinkable for a normal human being. At 4 degrees temperature at night they are asked to go 10kms up the achingly slow hilly-terrain carrying weights more than their own body weight. After which they go through a number of stressful exercises followed by the 10km return trip. With no sleep and meager food and almost no water they are put through combat skill tests under near death conditions at the end of 36 hours. Their training also includes a 100 km endurance run with 10 kg weight. Still their spirit is not broken and they showcase extreme will power to hang on and continue, ignoring their cramped muscles and sore feet.</p>

<p>
All this to get the coveted maroon beret and adorn their shoulder with the 'Balidan' batch which obliges    them to be committed to their duties even in most precarious situations and always put the country before everything else.<br>
You must be wondering why am I telling the training regime of the special forces here; it is because I want the readers to realize that there exist certain individuals who can put their lives through anything to protect us and then there exists this father (who live off on the salary received from an Indian government job) of the alleged militant Burhan Wani who was killed in an Army operation who is all over the Indian media backing Pakistan over the Uri attacks. Then there are people who still want to care about securing the cultural ties between the two countries and mourning about the boycott of their favorite star. The people may be innocent but their government isn't.
